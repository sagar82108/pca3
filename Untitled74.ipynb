    "Q1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:\n",
    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvalues** are scalars associated with a square matrix.\n",
    "For a given matrix A, \n",
    "an eigenvalue (λ) represents a scalar value such that\n",
    "when A is multiplied by a specific vector (the corresponding eigenvector),\n",
    "the result is a scaled version of that vector. Mathematically, \n",
    "if v is an eigenvector of A corresponding to eigenvalue λ, then Av = λv.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvectors** are non-zero vectors that, when transformed by a matrix, \n",
    "only change in scale, but not in direction. \n",

    "Eigen-Decomposition Approach:\n",
    "Eigen-decomposition is a method used to decompose a square matrix A \n",
    "into three components: a matrix of its eigenvectors, \n",

    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "If A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, it means P is a full-rank matrix.\n",
    "A full-rank matrix has n linearly independent columns, making it invertible.\n",

    "Q4. Significance of Spectral Theorem:\n",
    "The Spectral Theorem states that for a Hermitian (real symmetric) matrix, \n",

    "\n",
    "Q5. Finding Eigenvalues:\n",
    "Eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation |A - λI| = 0,\n",
    "where A is the matrix, λ is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix. \n",
    "Solving this equation yields the eigenvalues, which represent the scaling\n",
    "factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues Relationship:\n",
    "Eigenvectors are associated with eigenvalues.\n",
    "Each eigenvalue has a corresponding eigenvector.\n",
    "Eigenvectors represent the directions along which the matrix transformation only scales the vector,\n",

    "Eigenvectors represent the principal axes of a linear transformation. \n",
    "Eigenvalues indicate the scaling along these axes. \n",

    "Eigen decomposition has applications in various fields, including:\n",
    "1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to \n",

    "\n",
    "Q9. Multiple Sets of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:\n",
    "A matrix can have multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.\n",
    "This occurs when the matrix has repeated eigenvalues,\n",
